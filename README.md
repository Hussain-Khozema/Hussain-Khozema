Over 8 years of programming experience and hands-on experience in various fields such as Machine Learning, Data Science, Database systems, Distributed systems, Cloud technologies and Full-Stack Development. I also have a demonstrated history of working in the information technology field, mainly in the services, e-commerce, and fintech industries. I have a very keen interest in this field and love to do what I do and am looking for new opportunities where I can learn and apply new skills as well as gain experience while bringing outstanding dedication to the company.
